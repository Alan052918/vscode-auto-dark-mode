# auto-dark-mode

Automatically switch between light and dark themes depending on the system dark mode toggle.

## Status

This extension is under heavy development, and is not stable.

## Known issues

The extension can **only** switch from the `Default Light+` to the `Default Dark+` theme, and vice versa. That means that you have to manually set your theme to one of these before the extension will start working.
